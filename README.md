# ImageClassification

This projectâ€™s aim was to build a model using deep convolutional neural network to classify images into three different classes. 

The project was run on google colab. train.py is used for training the model, test.py is used for testing the model, and train_tensorflow.ipynb 

records the tuning process of the model.
